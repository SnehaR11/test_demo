    <p> The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God.

        What I know of the divine sciences and Holy Scriptures, I learned in woods and fields. I have no other masters than the beeches and the oaks. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux
        
        I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station, through which God speaks to us every hour, if we only will tune in. George Washington Carver
